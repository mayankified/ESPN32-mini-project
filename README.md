Weather (temp. and humidity) monitoring on OLED display with Realtime Email Reporting


Weather monitoring with real-time temperature and humidity data displayed on an OLED screen and instant email reporting is achieved through ESP32, a powerful microcontroller. Sensors like DHT22/DHT11 collect accurate environmental data, which is processed and displayed on the OLED screen. Simultaneously, the ESP32 sends real-time updates via email, enabling remote monitoring and timely notifications. This integrated system enhances accessibility and convenience for users.
